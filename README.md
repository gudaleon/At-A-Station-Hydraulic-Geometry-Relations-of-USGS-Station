# At-A-Station-Hydraulic-Geometry-Relations-of-USGS-Station

Natural streams are characterized by variation in cross-section geometry, bed-slope, bed roughness, hydraulic slope, etc., along their channels resulting from several interacting features of the riverine system including the effects of discharge changes, geologic context, sediment load, etc. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of river flow dynamics requires sufficient knowledge of hydraulics and these geophysical variables. 

This code helps in producing “At-A-Station” hydraulic geometry (AHG) relations at a USGS river monitoring station. AHG relations are site-specific power-functions, relating the mean stream channel forms (i.e. water depth, top-width, flow velocity, and flow area) to discharge.
