# At-A-Station-Hydraulic-Geometry-Relations-of-USGS-Station
This code helps in producing “At-A-Station” hydraulic geometry (AHG) relations at a USGS river monitoring station. AHG relations are site-specific power-functions, relating the mean stream channel forms (i.e. water depth, top-width, flow velocity, and flow area) to discharge
