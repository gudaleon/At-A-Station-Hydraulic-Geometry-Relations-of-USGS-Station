% Name: At-A-Station Hydraulic Geometry Relations of USGS Stations 
%
% Description: 
%     Natural streams are characterized by variation in cross-section geometry,
%   bed-slope, bed roughness, hydraulic slope, etc., along their channels
%   resulting from several interacting features of the riverine system including 
%   the effects of discharge changes, geologic context, sediment load, etc. 
%   Quantitative and qualitative assessment of river flow dynamics requires
%   sufficient knowledge of hydraulics and these geophysical variables. 
%
%     Average flow condition theory expressed as At-A-Station hydraulic geometry (AHG)
%   relations are site-specific power-functions, relating the mean stream
%   channel forms (i.e. water depth, top-width, flow velocity, and flow area) to discharge
%
% The Script Introduction:
%     The current script is created for establishing the robust power-law
%     AHG relations at a USGS river monitoring stations. Given a USGS
%     station ID (e.g. '01064118'), sub-sampling size to be applied in
%     Modified Cross-Validation Regression Diagnostic (Afshari et. al.,
%     2017), and computation unit (e.g. 'SI'), a new directory will be automatically
%     created to stored the following products:
%
%     1. MAT files:
%        1.1. {USGS station ID}_DailyPeaks_Data: 
%          1.1.1. BankFull_Discharge: 
%                 Bankfull Flow corresponding to 1.5-year flood event

%          1.1.2. Discharge_GageHeight_Cell_Proper: 
%                 Cell table containing peak stream flow and gage height
%                 records (all in English unit that is the USGS source
%                 unit) and corresponding measurement attributes. It is the
%                 annual maximum instantaneous peak streamflow and gage
%                 height of a USGS station. 
%          1.1.3. index_Unsorted_Discharge_peak and

%          1.1.4. X_exploratory and Y_response:
%                 respectively containing stream flow and corresponding gage height
%                 values extracted from Discharge_GageHeight_Cell_Proper
%                 cell table and converted to specified computation unit.
%          1.1.5. Max_Water_Year_Discharge_Sorted_cell:
%                 Cell table containing computed flood years at the USGS
%                 station based on the specified computation unit.
%          1.1.6. Indx_bankfull:
%                 Indices of within bankfull stage streamflow and gage height
%                 values in X_exploratory and Y_response matrices.

%        1.3. {USGS station ID}_usgs_site_AHG:
%          1.3.1. USGS_Data_AHG_Table:
%                 Cell table containing USGS site geospatial information,
%                 the estimates of AHG exponent and coefficients, 
%                 estimated shape of bed geometry (power-law exponent), 
%                 full number of field measured records, number
%                 of reliable field measured records.
